# Jokeware
This is a little Jokeware I did during some classes in University.
When you execute the .jar file or the code in a IDE, it will start to popup a lot of messages 
and images (of your choosing) randomly throughout the computer screen and a sound (also of your choosing)
will play as well

I added some changes to the code itself so you know what do you need to change in order to select the files
you want to appear/play

Enjoy it :)
